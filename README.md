Todo

1. Two-way contact
2. Profile page design
3. Photo picker after invite
4. Get photographers to sign up

- "Hover over picture" on homepage to uncover more pics
- Profile information is too below the fold
- More control over hero slider
- All assets still on 500px cdn
- Email verification/confirmation
- CSS/JS is a mess
