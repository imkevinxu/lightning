        <p>I started my journey in photography when my dad gave me his Nikon SLR (the F-501) to use for high school yearbook. It allowed me to capture the moments that others on the team missed. In college, I was blessed to be an early adopter of a Sony Cyber-shotF55 digital camera and quickly became the dorm historian everywhere I lived. These days, I primarily shoot with my trusty Canon EOS 5D Mark II digital SLR. (For a closer look at the gear I use, see the Gear page.) The technology is changing so fast, enabling us to see the world through the lens in new ways each day. I can’t wait to see what’s just around the corner!</p>

        <p>In addition to being a freelance photographer, I’m also a technology consultant, multimedia workshop instructor, and computer repair guy.</p>
