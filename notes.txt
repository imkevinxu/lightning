- "Hover over picture" on homepage to uncover more pics
- Profile information is too below the fold
- More control over hero slider
- Slow to load images on mobile cause they're so friken big. Play with 1-4 quality endpoints
- All assets still on 500px cdn fhpcdn.
- PROBLEM: login needs a USERNAME but we only ask them for an EMAIL at login. We then check the email against the 500px API to get their 500px username but never give them a chance to edit or know about it. Need to update script so that User.username IS ALSO User.email BUT we also save the 500px username somewhere.... gahhhhh. And basically all the people that have been seeded have usernames but no emails or passwords
- CSS is a friken mess
- Invite-only
- Email verification/confirmation
- Filter for location should actually detect location......
